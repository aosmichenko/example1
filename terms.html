								<h3>1. Benebit Platform:</h3>
								<p>Benebit acts as a hub that connects consumers with businesses by fulfilling the need

									cashback and rewards, by introducing Benebit Tokens (BNE) and the online marketplace
									‘Benebit Blockchain&#39;, where transactions take place in single-currency BNEs on a
									global scale. There are no borders, no regulations and no restrictions by central
									bodies. Rather, all transactions are on a distributed-ledger Blockchain without the
									involvement of central authorities, thus making it safe, secure and auditable due to
									its distributed nature over P2P nodes.</p>

								<h3>5. Refunds, Refusals, Suspension and Termination of Contributions</h3>
								<p>The user understands and acknowledge that there might be some risks owing to the
									development process,
									company success, as well as risks relating to blockchain, transactions or
									unanticipated risks. By
									taking part in the token sale a user confirms that he/she is aware of the following
									and/or other
									associated unmentioned risks and that the company would not be liable to bear any
									loss owing to
									these risks. If you are not willing to acknowledge and accept these risks in the
									future DO NOT BUY
									BNE TOKENS. The probable future risks might include but are not limited to the
									following:</p>
								<ul class="sub-list">
									<li class="li"><span class="number">5.1 </span>
										<p>Risk of software weakness: The user should be aware of the fact that there
											are no warranties
											or
											assurances to the perfect, uninterrupted or error-free working of the smart
											contract system
											or other
											underlying software. Thus, there is an inherent risk that the software could
											contain
											defects,
											weaknesses, vulnerabilities, viruses or bugs, causing inter alia, the
											complete loss of
											contributions
											and/or STU. If such bugs, defects and/or viruses affect the creation of BNE
											tokens or in
											some way
											affect the contributions of the contributor the company in no situation
											shall be held
											responsible
											for the loss and/or be liable to bear any loss and/or return of the
											amount.</p>
									</li>
									<li class="li"><span class="number">5.2 </span>
										<p>Regulatory risk: Blockchain is a new technology and many aspects of
											blockchain are yet
											improving
											including its development, utilization as well as associated regulations.
											The user shall
											acknowledge
											and accept that the current regulations and laws on blockchain might change
											in future and
											that these
											regulations might affect their experience. Future regulations might affect
											the current smart
											contract system and/or the Benebit platform and lead to termination or loss
											of BNE tokens
											for the
											contributor.</p>
									</li>
									<li class="li"><span class="number">5.3 </span>
										<p>Risk of loss of private key: The user should be well aware of the blockchain
											and its
											processes. Thus,
											you should acknowledge and accept that your information, such as ‘Private
											Key(s)&#39; and
											‘Password(s)&#39;
											is essential to access your wallet and thus the BNE tokens. If you lose your
											Private Key
											and/or
											Password, you will not be able to access your wallet and BNE tokens and thus
											you will lose
											all your
											tokens permanently.</p>
									</li>
									<li class="li"><span class="number">5.4 </span>
										<p>Risk of theft/mining attacks: Users shall acknowledge and accept that despite
											blockchain
											being a very
											secure platform, there might be some risks of theft and mining attacks,
											double-spend
											attacks,
											majority mining power attacks, &#8220;selfish-mining&#8221; attacks, rare condition
											attacks, malware
											attacks,
											denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing
											and spoofing.
											Any such
											successful attacks can result in loss of BNE tokens, improper functioning of
											software,
											irregular
											transactions and/or improper smart contract computations.</p>
									</li>
									<li class="li"><span class="number">5.5 </span>
										<p>Risk of incompatible wallet services: BNE tokens are ERC20 compatible tokens
											thus you shall
											first
											ensure that you own an ERC20 compatible token wallet or else you might lose
											access to the
											BNE tokens
											you buy, and the company will hold no responsibility for it.</p>
									</li>
									<li class="li"><span class="number">5.6 </span>
										<p>Risk arising from taxes: There are no certain tax characterization of the BNE
											tokens thus the
											contributor shall refer to his/her tax advisor for the transfer, usage and
											storage of BNE
											tokens.
											The customer shall be well aware of the tax regulations including
											withholding taxes,
											transfer taxes,
											value added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other
											charges and tax
											reporting
											requirements applicable in their geographical area. The contributor shall
											bear any loss
											resulting
											from not adhering to regional and national tax regulations him/herself.</p>
									</li>
									<li class="li"><span class="number">5.7 </span>
										<p>Risk of uninsured losses: Unless you obtain a private insurance for the BNE
											tokens you hold,
											they are
											otherwise uninsured. Thus, we can offer you no recourse on the loss of BNE
											tokens or their
											value.</p>
									</li>
									<li class="li"><span class="number">5.8 </span>
										<p>Unanticipated risks: The contributor acknowledges and accepts that there

											affecting
											the growth of company or the utility of BNE tokens the contributor will bear
